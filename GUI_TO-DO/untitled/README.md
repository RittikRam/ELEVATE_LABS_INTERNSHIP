# Java To-Do App

## Task 6: Java GUI - ToDo App

This repository contains a simple To-Do list application built with Java Swing as part of the Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship.

### Objective
The main goal of this project was to learn and practice building a desktop Graphical User Interface (GUI) application using Java. The application allows a user to add and delete tasks from a list.

### Key Concepts Applied
* **Swing**: Used as the primary toolkit for creating the GUI components.
* **JFrame**: The main window of the application.
* **JButton & JTextField**: Components for user interaction (buttons for actions and a text field for input).
* **JList & DefaultListModel**: Used to display and manage the list of to-do items.
* **JScrollPane**: Added to the `JList` to handle scrolling when the number of tasks exceeds the window size.
* **Layout Managers**: `BorderLayout` and `JPanel` were used to organize and position the components within the frame.
* **Event Handling**: Implemented `ActionListener` to respond to button clicks for adding and deleting tasks.

### How to Run the Application
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-GitHub-Repo-Link]
    ```
2.  **Open in an IDE**:
    Open the project in a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3.  **Run the `Main` Class**:
    Locate the `Main.java` file and run it. The application window should appear.

### Screenshots (Optional)
